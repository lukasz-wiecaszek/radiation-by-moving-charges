# Radiation By Moving Charges

This is set of Python programs designed to simulate electromagnetic radiation
produced by different configurations of moving point charges.
All those programs are complementary parts to the chapters in the article
under the same name "Radiation By Moving Charges".
The article itself will/shall be available here once it is finished,
so please give me some time yet to finalize it.

Charge configurations which are covered by the article and python program are:
- Charge moving with arbitrary velocity
- Charge moving with constant velocity
- Charge moving with constant angular velocity
- Oscillating single charge
- Oscillating electric dipole
